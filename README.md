# Sharing Is Caring

## Cause

I've decided to focus on animal welfare & cruelty and will be demonstrating my support for this on my site by promoting a charity that shares the same beliefs as me, which is the international animal charity named FOUR PAWS, who believe in a world where humans treat animals with respect, empathy and understanding.

## Target Audience

While I originally wanted to use a cartoon character to guide visitors through my site, I used feedback I had gotten to my wireframe sketches in order to adapt my site to something that would be taken more seriously, as I didn't want the site to come across as childish or insensitive. Now, I'm targeting adults who will appreciate and have a better understanding of what the cause is about.

## End Result

My aim is for visitors to the site to either sponsor an animal, or at least spread awareness of the cause. An animal can be sponsored through the links I provide on my site, which take you to the FOUR PAWS site where you can do that. Referring back to my target audience, as a child isn't going to have a credit card in order to pay to sponsor an animal every month, I think it was an overall smarter choice to focus mainly on ages 18 and over.
